CMPUT 379 Assignment 3
Name: Benjamin Kong
CCID: bkong

Files:
- src (contains client and server directories)
    - Server (contains source files for server)
        - server.cpp (server entry point)
    - Client (contains source files for client)
        - client.cpp (client entry point)
- Makefile (used to compile and link the server and client programs)
- README (provides assumptions and instructions)

Assumptions:
- The `port` number must be in the range 5,000 to 64,000.

Approach:
- TODO

Instructions (server):
1. In the directory with `Makefile`, run `make server`. This will create the server executable.
2. Run `./server port` to start the server where `port` is the port number the server will listen to.

Instructions (client):
1. In the directory with `Makefile`, run `make client`. This will create the client executable.
2. Run `./client port ip-address` to start the client where `port` is the port number the server will read from and `ip-address` is the IP address of the machine that is hosting the server.
